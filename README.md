# Universal Credit checklist

This is a checklist web app using the GOV.UK styleguide. It is the result of a Catalyst-funded project running for 11 weeks from January to March 2021.

> This challenge is to prototype and test ways of providing remote support for individuals struggling or failing to make Universal Credit claims online for reasons like a lack of digital or language skills, or mental health issues.

## How to run it on your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dynamicskillset/catalyst-uc-checklist.git
```
Then simply open the `index.html` with your favourited browser.

## How we built it

We tried to follow as much as possible the [GOV UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/). 
To save the checked items on local storage it has been used [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine).
